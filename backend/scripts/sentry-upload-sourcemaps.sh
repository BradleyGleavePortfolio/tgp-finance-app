# Upload compiled sourcemaps to Sentry so the dashboard renders readable
# stack traces instead of minified column numbers from dist/.
#
# When invoked from the Dockerfile build stage, this script runs *after*
# `npm run build` has produced dist/ + dist/**/*.map. The release name is
# read from RELEASE_VERSION — the same variable instrument.ts uses at runtime
# — so what we upload here lines up with what Sentry sees on captured events.
#
# Behaviour:
#   - SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN unset       → no-op (build still succeeds locally and
#                                      in CI environments without secrets).
#   - SENTRY_DSN unset              → no-op (no project to upload to).
#   - RELEASE_VERSION unset         → no-op with a printed warning; uploading
#                                      to a placeholder release would attach
#                                      maps to an event Sentry never receives.
#   - SENTRY_ORG / SENTRY_PROJECT
#     unset                         → no-op with a printed warning; the CLI
#                                      cannot resolve a project without them.
#
# Required Fly / GitHub Actions secrets when full upload is desired:
#   SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN   internal-integration token, scope: project:releases
#   SENTRY_ORG          e.g. "the-growth-project"
#   SENTRY_PROJECT      e.g. "tgp-finance-api"
#
# RELEASE_VERSION is supplied as a Docker build arg from the CI workflow
# (typically the commit SHA). The runtime uses the same value so events
# and sourcemaps share a release.
